# Final project for IBM Developing AI Applications With Python and Flask

Used Python and Flask to create a web app and deploy it. I used the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.
<br>
<br>
Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.'

<br>
Completed these 8 tasks:
<br>
Task 1: Clone the project repository
<br>
Task 2: Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library
<br>
Task 3: Format the output of the application
<br>
Task 4: Package the application
<br>
Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application
<br>
Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask
<br>
Task 7: Incorporate Error handling
<br>
Task 8: Run static code analysis
