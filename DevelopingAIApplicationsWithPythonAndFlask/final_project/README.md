# Final project for IBM Developing AI Applications With Python and Flask

Used Python and Flask to create a web app and deploy it. I used the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.



Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.'



Completed these 8 tasks:
Task 1: Clone the project repository
Task 2: Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library
Task 3: Format the output of the application
Task 4: Package the application
Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application
Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask
Task 7: Incorporate Error handling
Task 8: Run static code analysis
